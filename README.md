🏥🧬🔬 This project aimed to develop a machine learning model for the detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in patients. We trained several classification algorithms on a dataset of patient information, including age, blood pressure, and various blood test results, to predict whether a patient has CKD or not.

To improve the performance of our models, we utilized hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize our model parameters and prevent overfitting by using cross-validation techniques. We also conducted data preprocessing and preparation to ensure the dataset was clean and ready for training.
